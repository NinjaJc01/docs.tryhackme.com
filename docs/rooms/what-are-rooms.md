## What are rooms?
Rooms are a virtual space where you can easily allocate tasks to the users. You can create rooms for challenges (CTFs) or to run a particular workshop or teaching session. Each room is a page on the TryHackMe site.

A room is broken down into one or more **Tasks**. A task can have downloadable material or a virtual machine attached. Each task has one or more question(s), and a description.
